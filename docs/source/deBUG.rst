NCSU Bioinformatics Users Group
===============================
This group consists of NC State faculty, staff, and students who are using bioinformatics software. It will be used to organize and announce meetings and for users to exchange information and advice on using various bioinformatics applications.

BUG Software List - please contribute!
*************************************************

A bioinformatics researcher may try dozens (or more) of different software applications in the course of a single analysis.  One important mission of this group is to document scripts and workflows for software and make them freely available to others such that they do not have to start from scratch.

The following `google spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L6tQfqHJ1sBqRgmHsjx1u7Ox02WOIY65fpNg2wNHsRQ/edit?usp=sharing>`_ contains a list of various bioinformatics applications.  At the moment, it is a skeleton document that contains a suggested way of displaying available information.  The software listed is available on the HPC via the software groups 'bioinfo' and 'spack', but there is very little documentation available so far.

This effort to gather information on bioinformatics applications will only succeed if users contribute to the knowledge pool.  Please share your compilation notes, run scripts, and best practices for using.  If you have links to tutorials or sample data sets, please share them as well.  This group will provide a mechanism for organizing and sharing those submissions.
