Welcome to the NCSU Bioinformatics Users Group!
===============================================

We are a group of scientists in a variety of different fields brought together 
by a need for high performance computing via NCSU's HPC. We hope to foster an open
and welcoming forum where users can exchange information and advice on using various bioinformatics applications.
Please join the Bioinformatics Users group's (deBUG) google
group found here `<https://groups.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forum/#!forum/group-bioinformatics-users>`_.
